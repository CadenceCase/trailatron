# Basic Programming in JavaScript and Node

This guide assumes you are using Node `7.5.0` or higher

## Skills

*Node:*

- [ ] can install node via homebrew
- [ ] can create and execute a JavaScript file using node
- [ ] can exports an object in one file and import it from another file
- [ ] can create a new node package using `npm init`
- [ ] can install and save dependencies to a node package
- [ ] can add `./node_modules/.bin` to your `$PATH`
- [ ] can write to STDOUT using `console.log`
- [ ] can access environment variables
- [ ] can access command line arguments `process.argv`
- [ ] can run a script with environment variables specified in the terminal command
- [ ] can read and write the contents of a file
- [ ] can append to a file

*Programming*

- [ ] can explain what an operator is and can list several common ones
- [ ] can explain the concept of operator precedence and can show how to be explicit about it
- [ ] can use the following objects:
  - [ ] Array
  - [ ] Hash / Map
  - [ ] Function
- [ ] can explain what "flow control" means
- [ ] can use the following tools to control the flow of a program:
  - [ ] if / else
  - [ ] return
  - [ ] while / for
- [ ] can articulate the difference between explicit and implicit returns
- [ ] can explain how a function can be passed into another function and can list at least 2 examples of when you might do that
- [ ] can explain what each of these enumerable methods do
  - [ ] each
  - [ ] map
  - [ ] filter
  - [ ] find
- [ ] can explain a callback and give 1 example of when we would need one
- [ ] can read an error backtrace and identify the line of their code that led to that error

*JavaScript:*


- [ ] can use `console.log` to debug errors in a program
- [ ] can articulate the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript
- [ ] can articulate the difference between `function open(){}` vs `open = function(){}`
- [ ] can articulate the relationship between a function and its `.prototype` object
- [ ] can write simple tests using `assert`
- [ ] can explain how Lexical Scope chaining works in JavaScript
- ~~(anything around Constructors or `this`)~~
- ~~(anything asynchronous)~~

## Goals

- IDEA: goal to learn testing:
  - learn about code objects and enumerable functions
  - then write a simple `assert` function yourself
  - then use it to write tests for those native objects
