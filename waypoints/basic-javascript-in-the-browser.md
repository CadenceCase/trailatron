- [ a goal should include a left sidebar slide out ]
- [ a goal should include re-implementing simple input-output exercises that were done in "Basic Programming" again using forms ]
- goal idea:
  - series of simple interfaces to build with escalating complexity
    - 1) two fields that add and show a total
